Description: Capable of deriving seasonal statistics, such as
        "normals", and analysis of seasonal data, such as departures.
        This package also has graphics capabilities for representing
        seasonal data, including boxplots for seasonal parameters, and
        bars for summed normals. There are many specific functions
        related to climatology, including precipitation normals,
        temperature normals, cumulative precipitation departures and
        precipitation interarrivals. However, this package is designed
        to represent any time-varying parameter with a discernible
        seasonal signal, such as found in hydrology and ecology.
