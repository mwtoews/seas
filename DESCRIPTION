Description: Capable of deriving seasonal statistics, such as "normals", and
  analysis of seasonal data, such as departures. This package also has graphics
  capabilities for representing seasonal data, including boxplots for seasonal
  parameters, and bars for summed normals. There are many specific functions
  related to climatology, including precipitation normals, temperature normals,
  cumulative precipitation departures and precipitation interarrivals. However,
  this package is designed to represent any time-varying parameter with a
  discernible seasonal signal, such as found in hydrology and ecology.
