Description
-----------

Capable of deriving seasonal statistics, such as "normals", and
analysis of seasonal data, such as departures. This package also has
graphics capabilities for representing seasonal data, including boxplots for
seasonal parameters, and bars for summed normals. There are many specific
functions related to climatology, including precipitation normals,
temperature normals, cumulative precipitation departures and precipitation
interarrivals. However, this package is designed to represent any
time-varying parameter with a discernible seasonal signal, such as found
in hydrology and ecology [1]_.
