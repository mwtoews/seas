 - update documentation and examples for R 2.11

Version 0.3-8
2007-10-01
 - fix bug with write.help for Visual HELP precipitation file
 - fix partial matching errors in 'dathomog', identified by BDR
 - other documentation fixes identified using 2.7.0 devel series

Version 0.3-7
2007-08-04
 - update to new email address
 - using original items for 'par("yaxt")' in 'plot.seas.var'
 - fixed bug in 'write.help.R'

Version 0.3-6
2007-06-07
 - added an 'ann' option in 'seas.label' for 'image.seas.sum'
 - modified 'conv365toGregorian' to copy attributes from 'x' into output
 - fixed precipitation unit in 'plot.year'
 - 'seas.df.check' now looks for 'start.day'
 - 'write.help' now calculates 'year' to 'dat'
 - updated citation; paper now published

Version 0.3-5
2007-04-22
 - rewrote 'write.help' to use C-code for speed, also have load/unload
    functions for the dynamic library
 - added 'conv365toGregorian' function
 - rearranged functions that used a 'year.length' attribute or parameter
    to instead use a 'calendar' attribute or parameter
 - added 'year.length' function to determine the number of days per year
 - modified the behaviour of 'mksub' a bit, so it doesn't strip attributes
    from arrays used in data frames; instead certain attributes are not
    transfered
 - casting integers for 'sprintf' calls for significant speed gains, in
    particular in 'read.lars'
 - simplified 'change' by removing the first 'var' parameter

Version 0.3-4
2007-04-02
 - fixed minor error with named attributes for R 2.5.0
 - fixed error in 'plot.seas.temp' when 't_mean' is missing
 - 'read.sdsm' now considers units
 - 'read.lars' rewritten - now reads 'st' file for meta-data, then reads
    'sr/dat' file from the meta-data in 'st'
 - added doi from Elsevier to paper/package 'citation("seas")'
 - brought back 'ylog' parameter to 'plot.seas.var', now does
    log-transformed boxplots, and can be used with 'add.alt=TRUE'
 - removed 'yaxs="i"' from a few functions; these can be set normally
    through 'par', if desired
 - allowed 'par("ylog")' to work with 'plot.seas.sum'

Version 0.3-3
2007-02-26
 - Modified 'read.sdsm' to adapt to year.length=360 better, added attr too
 - fixed documentation for 'mkseas' usage
 - fixed handling of '.seasylab' in 'hidden.R[d]'; using 'var', not 'orig'
 - 'change' now stores 'p.cut' attributes
 - 'interarrival' now stores 'p.cut' and 'inv' attributes
 - fixed problem with character encoding in 'mscdata'
 
Version 0.3-2
2006-11-08
 - several fixes from 0.3-1
 - 'plot.seas.norm' no longer re-sets the options, and now 'leg' can
   use c(x,y) to place legend
 - fixed par(ylog=TRUE) for 'plot.seas.var'
 - fixed 'mscdata' example
 - fix in 'mkseas' with proper order of 'days' (or 'bin.lengths')
 - re-added 'ylab' into a few plotting functions
 - fixed 'mksub' error if data.frame element is 'array'
 - made axises for most plotting functions to respect par('lwd')
 - new option 'seas.bxp' for boxplot fill colour and outlier size

Version 0.3-1
2006-10-25
 - lots of changes in this release: some functions added, or renamed
 - moved 'mkfact' to 'mkseas', and it is more flexible, and can start
   on different dates, such as 'Aug 1'
 - added 'mkann' to complement 'mkseas', which finds the annual breaks
   between seasons; this is simple if 'start.day' is January 1st, but
   seasons don't need to star here anymore
 - more use of 'attr' to pass meta-data between objects; such as 'units'
   and 'long.name' for variables in data frames
 - 'mscdata' and 'read.msc' now uses attributes for storing long names
   and units for each variable
 - data must be subdivided by 'mksub', as the plotting functions have
   changed or removed 'start', 'end', and 'id'
 - 'mksub's 'start' and 'end' parameters now either accept an integer
   year or a 'Date' class
 - plotting functions now use 'start' to designate a starting bin, and
   'rep' to repeat some bins 
 - the grid from '.seasmonthgrid' is more exact to the actual month
   boundaries

Version 0.2-1
2006-04-05
 - removed 'degday' and 'growday' since they were not needed
 - fixed 'plot.seas.norm' for plotting non-precipitation items
 - renamed 'param*' to 'var*' and 'parameter*' to 'variable*' (where
      appropriate); this is to reduce confusion between the two names,
      however it may lead to further confusion with the 'var' function
 - increased contrast in grey-scale theme
 - moved the null theme in 'hidden.R' from 3 to 0
 - added 'read.sdsm' and 'write.sdsm' functions
 - added 'plot' method for 'seas.sum' objects, which shows boxplots
 - submitted article for 'seas' package to 'Computers & Geosciences'

Version 0.1-3
2006-03-14
 - added .seascol and changed hplot functions to accommodate modular
	colouring styles
 - re-tabbed everything in Emacs
 - renamed package from 'climate.plot' to 'seas'
 - made 'mkfact' a bit more flexible, looks for Date/POSIXct classes
 - made '.seasmonthgrid' in hidden.R
 - added new style to accommodate no title
 - restructured 'seas.sum' object:
   - 'days', 'na' are separate 2D arrays (used to be part of 'seas')
   - 'active' is 3D, and only present if 'a.cut' is non-zero or FALSE
 - fixed a few bugs in 'seas.norm'; added '...' to 'precip.norm'

Version 0.1-2
2006-02-13
 - added 'ZipData: no' for Windows packaging of non-R data

Version 0.1.1
2006-02-11
 - removed Unicode for 'mkfact' in-order to work for R CMD check on C locale

Version	0.1
2006-02-10
